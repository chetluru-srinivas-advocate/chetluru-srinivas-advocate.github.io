# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## Problem Resolved

The error "Dependencies lock file is not found" occurred because your GitHub Actions workflow was configured to use `npm ci` (which requires a lock file) but your repository didn't have a `package-lock.json` file.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created package-lock.json
- Generated `package-lock.json` using `npm install --package-lock-only --legacy-peer-deps`
- This file ensures reproducible builds across different environments
- The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag resolves ESLint version conflicts in your dependencies

### 2. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
- Fixed the workflow to use `npm ci --legacy-peer-deps` for faster, reliable installs
- Re-enabled npm caching now that we have a lock file
- Maintained the static export configuration for GitHub Pages

### 3. Updated Local Deploy Script (deploy.sh)
- Changed from `yarn build` to `npm run build` for consistency
- Added dependency installation step
- Uses the same flags as the GitHub Actions workflow

## Next Steps

### For GitHub Pages Deployment:

1. **Commit and push your changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Add package-lock.json and update deployment configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages (if not already done):**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click on "Settings" tab
   - Scroll down to "Pages" section
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
   - The workflow will automatically trigger on the next push

3. **Monitor the deployment:**
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
   - Watch the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
   - Once successful, your site will be available at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY_NAME`

### For Local Development:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

2. **Run development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Important Notes

- **Lock file**: Always commit `package-lock.json` to ensure consistent builds
- **Legacy peer deps**: The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is needed due to ESLint version conflicts
- **Static export**: Your Next.js app is configured for static export, perfect for GitHub Pages
- **Environment variables**: The build uses `NEXT_OUTPUT_MODE=export` and `NEXT_DIST_DIR=out`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Build fails locally:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions fails:**
   - Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs
   - Ensure `package-lock.json` is committed to the repository

3. **Site doesn't load:**
   - Verify GitHub Pages is enabled with "GitHub Actions" as source
   - Check that the build completed successfully
   - Ensure your repository is public (required for free GitHub Pages)

## File Structure After Fix

```
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/workflows/deploy.yml  # Updated GitHub Actions workflow
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json            # New: Dependency lock file
â”œâ”€â”€ deploy.sh                     # Updated: Uses npm instead of yarn
â”œâ”€â”€ next.config.js               # Existing: Static export configuration
â””â”€â”€ package.json                 # Existing: Project dependencies
```

Your deployment should now work correctly! ðŸš€
