    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>At Chetluru Srinivas & Associates, our Consumer Protection practice is dedicated to protecting the rights of consumers against unfair trade practices, defective products, and inadequate services. With the implementation of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which replaced the earlier 1986 Act, we have adapted our approach to leverage the enhanced provisions for consumer rights and remedies.</p>
    <p>Our team has extensive experience representing clients before Consumer Disputes Redressal Commissions at District, State, and National levels. We understand the nuances of consumer law in India and work diligently to secure fair compensation and justice for consumers who have been wronged by businesses and service providers.</p>
